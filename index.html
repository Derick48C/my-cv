    <h3>Who am I?</h3>
    <p>I am Derick.A patriotic Kenyan ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡ª siting at Konoin, Bomet c-036.I'm both a <span>Web developer</span> and a <span>Web Designer</span>.<br>
      <br>
      <span>Web Developer</span> -- Gets idea and planning of a website then creates the structure and the content of the web page.
      <br><br>
      <span>Web Designer</span> -- Makes the developer's structure and content to be an attracting (or to take users attention)  web page without changing the content of the developer. This is mainly by animating, coloring e.t.c
      <br><br><br>
      <code>Are you a practical learner -- Think of house building process ~ There is a mason (web developer) and a painter (web designer).</code>
    </p>
    <h3>What Can I Do?</h3>
    <p>I can build two types of a web page or websites.<br>These are :-
        <li>"Read Only" Page</li>
        <li>"Responsive" Page</li><br>
      <span>"Read Only" Page</span> -> This type of a page is just like any real letter or real book page. For example a <span>magazine</span>.The only differences (or why it should be preffered) is that, this page can be read anytime at anyplace via the internet (In other terms ~ its more flexible). This type has less designing and maintainance hence preffered by "till-door" businesses e.g photoshops 
      <br><br>
      <span id="response">"Responsive" Page</span> -> This type of page can real timely communicate with the user (customer).It actually consists of many responsive features e.g <br><br><button onclick="this.innerText = 'I AM NOW A DIFFERENT TEXT';">IF YOU CLICK ME I WILL CHANGE MY TEXT</button><br><br>Now you can witness how the page communicated different from the "Read Only" page.Type like such has got high designing and maintainance <br>~ <b>Are you asking yourself why? ðŸ¤”</b> ~ You well know that days changes after every 24 hours, this should also be same with your website. A page to get users attention it must be daily, weekly or monthly updated. For example if there is an international day , ofcourse you as the owner must wish users e.g "Happy Left-handed Day!!" e.t.c. (In simple term - <i>Updating your website</i>) 
    </p>

      <div class="quiz-view" >
        <div class="opt-one">
          <h5>No Human Is Limited</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="opt-two"> 
          <h4 id="hejfor" onclick="changeText(this.id)">NO HUMAN IS LIMITED</h3>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="mind-msg">Between the two, click that attracts you first ?</p>
    </div>
    <p><b><i>Just like anything that has advantages must have disadvantages - For now I can't create an online booking or ordering webpage.</i></b></p>
    <h3>Pricing</h3>
    <u><i><b>(Any figures displayed on pricing are in Kenyan Shillings ~ kes)</b></i></u><br><br>
    I know your big question is about pricing. Pricing depends on the quality and structuring of the content. It also depends on the type of the page, is it read only or responsive. <br><br>To be more precise a read only page has less designing and maintainance hence pricing is cheap whereelse responsive page has high designing and daily or weekly maintainance.<br><br> I won't be specific on pricing <a href="#response">responsive page</a> but for a read-only page is minimumly charged <u><b>1000kes to 2000kes</b></u> (depending on the content -- More the content , Pricing increases).<br><br>This type of page can permanently stay as created (no follow up activites). If the owner needs to update then he/she will be charged the maintainance fee (half the creation payment).<br><br>For responsive page creation fee always depends on the content quantity also quality.This may have many pages and other links or refferals.Creation fee ranges from <u><b>2000kes to 8000kes</b></u> apart from maintainace fee.<br> <li><b>Daily ~ 100kes - 250kes</b></li><li><b>Weekly ~ 650kes - 1,700kes</b></li><li><b>Monthly ~ 2,900kes - 7,400kes</b></li>
